## Hi! I'm an aspiring frontend developer based in Thailand.

### My current tech stack:
- React + Typescript + Vite
- HTML + CSS/TailwindCSS
- MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js
- Python (Rarely used nowaday)

### Tech or tools that I want/plan to learn:
- Golang, C
- Vue.js, Angular.js
- PostgreSQL

While I won an award for my project, I'm a novice in this field, so I will focus on filling my repo with silly and practical project for now.
