## My current tech stack:
- React + TypeScript/JavaScript + Vite

## Tech or tools that I want/plan to learn:
- Golang, C, or C++ if I'm good enough
- Vue.js, Next.js, Angular, Svelte
- AWS

## Education
- King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi - Production Engineering department (2021-2025)
- Suankularb Wittayalai School - English Program (2018-2021)
