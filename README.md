# Hi! I'm an aspiring frontend developer based in Thailand.
I'm graduated from KMUTT with a BEng in Production Engineering, but I wished to pursue the frontend developer career as I fall in love with the beautiful design.

## My current tech stack:
- React + Typescript + Vite
- HTML + CSS/TailwindCSS
- MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js
- Python (Rarely used nowaday)

## Tech or tools that I want/plan to learn:
- Golang, C
- Vue.js, Angular.js, Svelte
- PostgreSQL, AWS

## Education
- King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi - Production Engineering department (2021-2025)
- Suankularb Wittayalai School - English Program (2018-2021)

## Award
- 3rd place in Sustainable Bioeconomy and Smart Healthcare - KMUTT Project Day 2025
- 2nd place in Project Contest for Sustainable Future - Engineering Expo 2025 (hosted by Engineering Institute of Thailand)

While I won an award for my project (which I won't make my repo public), I'm a novice in this field. So I will focus on flooding my repo with both silly and practical projects for now.
